Frances has now been asked to help support a new investment initiative. Frances needs to perform analysis on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as part of a broader project her team has undertaken to support a new opportunity.

First, Frances has decided that she wants to better understand the price movements of AAPL as part of her research. She decides to use pandas and numpy to import and calculate the information she needs, and matplotlib to graph her results.

Frances decides to build a histogram of the daily rates of return for a 6 month period, and calculate the standard deviation of those returns to get a better understanding of the historical volatility of the stock during that 6 month period.

import codecademylib3_seaborn
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('AAPL_data.csv')
print(df.head())

df['Daily Log Rate of Return'] = np.log(df['Adj Close']/df['Adj Close'].shift(1))

print(df['Daily Log Rate of Return'])

stdev = np.std(df['Daily Log Rate of Return'])
print(stdev)

plt.hist(df['Daily Log Rate of Return'].dropna())
plt.title('Histogram of AAPL Daily Log Rates of Return')
plt.xlabel('Log Rate of Return')
plt.ylabel('Number of Days')
plt.show()
