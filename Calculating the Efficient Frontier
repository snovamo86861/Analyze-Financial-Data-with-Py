After feeling comfortable with her research, Frances needs to build a model portfolio with a basket of stocks, including AAPL, to present some recommendations to her team. She decides to construct her model portfolio with AAPL, Ford (NYSE: F), Dollar General (NYSE: DG), JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX).

Instead of going to a website to download information into csv format and using Excel to create her graphs, she decides to import stock information with quandl, and use pandas and numpy to perform calculations on her data, and matplotlib to plot her results. Frances will construct an “efficient frontier” to visualize the optimal portfolios of the five stocks she is looking into.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rf import return_portfolios, optimal_portfolio
import codecademylib3_seaborn
import numpy as np

path='quarters.csv'
stock_data = pd.read_csv(path)
print(stock_data.head())
selected=list(stock_data.columns[1:])

returns_quarterly = stock_data[selected].pct_change()
expected_returns = returns_quarterly.mean()
cov_quarterly = returns_quarterly.cov()

random_portfolios = return_portfolios(expected_returns, cov_quarterly) 

weights, returns, risks = optimal_portfolio(returns_quarterly[1:])

random_portfolios.plot.scatter(x='Volatility', y='Returns', fontsize=12)
try:
	plt.plot(risks, returns, 'y-o')
except:
  pass
plt.ylabel('Expected Returns',fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Volatility (Std. Deviation)',fontsize=14)
plt.title('Efficient Frontier', fontsize=24)
plt.show()
